# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Cut shortcut: `⌘X` / `Ctrl+X` copies selected items to the clipboard then deletes them. Undo restores the deleted items.
- Keyboard shortcuts help dialog: press `?` or click the `?` toolbar button to open an overlay listing every keyboard shortcut and tip.
- Fit-to-view: press `F` or click the ⊡ toolbar button to zoom and pan so all items on the current board are visible at once.
- Select all: `⌘A` / `Ctrl+A` selects every item on the board.
- Copy / paste: `⌘C` / `Ctrl+C` copies selected items; `⌘V` / `Ctrl+V` pastes them offset by 32 px with fresh IDs.
- Item locking: right-click any item and choose "Lock" to prevent it from being dragged or resized. A 🔒 badge appears on locked items. Unlock the same way. Locked items can still be selected, connected, labelled, and deleted.
- Nested boards: create sub-board portal items (`B` shortcut or 🗂️ toolbar button) that link to a child board. Double-click a portal card to navigate into the sub-board. A breadcrumb button in the top-left lets you navigate back to the parent board.
- Board templates: "New Board" now opens a dialog with a name field and four template choices (Empty, Cold Case, Research, Mood Board); each template pre-populates the board with labelled notes and connected strings.
- Onboarding example board: first-run now seeds a pre-populated "Welcome Board" with five annotated sticky notes and string connections, demonstrating notes, shortcuts, multi-board navigation, and the privacy model.
